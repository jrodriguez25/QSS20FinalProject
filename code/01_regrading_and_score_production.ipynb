    "OVERVIEW OF BELOW CODE:\n",
    "- The below code seeks to use the cleaned dataframe from Script 00 (our input) to regrade the test to accomodate for giving partial credit on short answer questions. The cleaning was not done to the extent that was needed for this part, so some more very basic cleaning is conducted. Because one of our goals is to see if there exists a correlation between getting certain questions correct and getting a higher score, this code will help us in our OLS regression. \n",
    "- The final output is a .csv file that contains the question number as a column name and the values are the scores. We can use a simple merging function to recombine this back with the original data. \n",
    "\n",
    "DEFINING THE FUNCTION:\n",
    "- Function name: regrading\n",
    "   - Purpose: Because the dataset 1) does not label the scores by question for each respondent, and we're hoping to see if there is a correlation between getting certain scores right and scoring higher on the exam and 2) because we are unsure how the short answer sections are graded, so we regraded such that they would be awarded as partial credit.\n",
    "   - Parameters: question (this is \"Q\" followed by the number of the question. For example, question 10 is labelled as Q10) and response (the student responses to the questions, pulled from the CSV file).\n",
