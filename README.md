# QSS20FinalProject

This is the beginning of the QSS 20 Final Project Repository for **Akshay Kelshiker, Edgar Ozuzun, Jeremy Rodriguez, Shawn Yoon.** The project hopes to investigate which questions in the pre-assessment that indicate a lower score in the final assessment. We plan on running an OLS regression of both bivariate and multivariate association within the given variables within the pre-assessment CSV file titled "Med student pre assessment 2.8.23". 

Building three main models, we first want to test only bivariate association between answering specific questions correct, our independent variable, and the final score, the ultimate dependent variable. In the second model, we want to test for possible confounding variables that influence the final score along with the specific questions, including gender, race, experience, and duration time of the test. In the last model, we plan to take the strongest confounding variable and test it alongside the independent variable of questions.
